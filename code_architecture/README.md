# Code Architecture Patterns & Techniques

## 1. Contract Segregation Pattern
- Separate contracts by core functionality (e.g., data storage, business logic, access control)
- Helps maintain Single Responsibility Principle
- Makes code more modular and easier to upgrade
- Reduces gas costs by allowing users to interact only with needed functionality
- Improves testability and auditability
